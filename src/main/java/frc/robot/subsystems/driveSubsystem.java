    // damn you copied a lot of my code. the "this" thing is kinda complicated and i forgot why i did it. I saw some
    // other team do it and i think it made some warning go away?
    // i forgot what it was but you should prob learn why the other teams did this in their code.
    // I think since you declare those variables inside this contrusctor the 'this' thing allows you to grab
    /* whatever you set it equal to somewhere else in your code. So for example its like if you made a variable inside your constructor.
    you shouldn't be able to grab that variable somewhere else outside your constructor, but if you do the "this" thing
    it tells ur compiler or sum to look at that variable/ object if its not declared somewhere else. Remember I was in season 
    when i learned most of coding so i was low on sleep, prob dead, and just looking for the best solutions for my code 
    so this might not be the best way to do it? it certainly is more confusing, but i think it made it faster or something
    to update the drive with the joystick values cause of the scheduler.
